## My Solutions: Updated ReadMe

As the JS30 challenge is a few years old, some of the code uses deprecated JS. I will be updating this as I go through each lesson. 

I will also be adding Accessibility in the form of visual descriptions for blind or low vision users who would like to try out the tools/apps. If you are disabled and have any feedback on this please contact me directly as I will be happy to make improvements to accessibility as I go.

Enjoy!
